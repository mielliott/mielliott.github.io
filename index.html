                Like most people with such web pages, I'm a college student currently attending the University of Florida. This fall marked the beginning of my fourth year as a computer engineering major. Hopefully within a year, as the plan stands, I'll be out of here. Well, out of the undergraduate arena. Graduate student life looms on the horizon. Is it something I'm excited for? Sure! But there's a part of me that wants to leave the swamp and keep the tassel-turning events to a minimum - the part that's tasted the blood of real world experience in the form of a summer internship.

            Kind of you to ask. Most notably, and as mentioned previously, I spent this past summer interning at Harman International. Specifically, their AMX branch, focused on all sorts of office peripherals from touch-displays that might explain what's going on inside a meeting room to conferencing devices that actually connect said meeting room to another on the opposite side of the world. My personal contribution was toward a product called the DGX. What that actually stands for, who knows. The device's purpose was to route audio and video signals from 32 discrete inputs to 32 outputs in any configuration imaginable. More specifically, my job was to aid the team in integrating surround sound downmixing functionality in order to greatly expand the range of audio input formats accepted by the device.

        <h2> Cool. But what did he actually learn?</h2>
        <div class = "my-text">
          <p>
            Long story short, I got my hands pretty dirty in the DGX's firmware. The entire codebase was written in C, which provided very intimate interaction with the system's hardware. I had to sift through quite a bit of documentation to know what bits needed to be communicated in order to interface different parts, which were complicated further by their different manufacturers.

            During the process, I became closely acquainted with the intricacies of both Dolby and DTS surround sound. Not their inner-workings, what actualliy makes them spin - that's for their desingers' eyes only - but with control commands needed by the audio decoders to interpret audio correctly. Again, running through the documentation and actually figuring out for myself how each module works was where the real challenge lay. I found that it's easy to take for granted the simple and direct intsructions often received by students without a second thought. The ability to discern another's designs and apply them to your own without having a clear-cut path proved just as integral to my work as understanding textbook hardware-softwwre interactions.

        <div class="my-text">

              You flatter me. I've always been drawn to playing musical instruments. Variety is where my true passion lies. Keyboards, stringed and percussive instruments, the occassional accordion... I enjoy playing literally every instrument I can get my hands on. That's not to say I'm remotely decent at all of them. The fun to be found in picking up a previously-unknown instrument and figuring out how to produce a somewhat-pleasant sound is a hobby largely propelled by my obsession with being challenged. The same applies to athletics, though in a more competitive sense. I don't much care what color the ball is or what appendages are involved; if there's a challenge to be had, I'm always interested.

            I'm going to go on a limb here and say they'd most likely mention something about cats. I've always been a sucker for four-legged felines.
